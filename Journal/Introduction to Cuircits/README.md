## Learn About Capacitors...
DO NOT mess up the polarity or else :collision::shit::skull:

Capacitors are used to store energy kind of like a battery. They can be helpful in filtering out centian singles, for example, a passive crossover for speakers, can filiter different frequinces. They are also used for any circuit that may require a large burst of power that without the use of a capacitor may blow a fuse in the power supply.

## Learn About AC/DC Electrical Current...
AC stands for alternating current and is the current that is in homes, certian areas of car electronics etc. Alternatining current changes direction, while Direct Current only flows in one direction. Direct Current is used in most electronics and curcuits we use today. Many that rely on a wall outlet will include what is called a converter which converts Aleternating Current to Direct Current.

## Learn About Transistors...
Transistors are mainly used for amplification. They are made of semiconductors. They can also be used as a switch. This can be down by having a small/weak curret go in, and then use the trainsistor to switch that to a higher/stronger current going out thus powering anything in the electrical path after that switch without needing to send the higher/stronger amount of current through the entire cuircuit. This function can also be used in the opposite way to switch a higher/stronger current down to a smaller/weaker current.
