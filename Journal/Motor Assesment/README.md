I took apart my motor to see the inside, but after doing so realized that there was no issues inside the actual housing.
The only issue with my motor was with the wires and pin connections. I cut the wires down to what was salvageable, then I 
cut new wire and stripped and soldered them to the salvagable wires of the motor. I then used the torque wire tension protector
to ensure that there was no stress being put on the solder joints.
