# Lesson 4 Shift Encoder

## Description
I used the shift encoder to power and program 8 LED's while only using 3 ports on the Arduino. This will allow for future projects to include many LED's as well as different components.

## Creative Add-on
None, I spent to long trying to fix the hardware issue, that I didn't recognize until class

## Problems
I trouble shot my electronics for a long time and realized finally once class started that the IC was backwards... :(
