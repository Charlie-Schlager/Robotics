# Lesson 15 DC Motor Reversing

## Description
I made an DC Motor be able to switch directions with the push of a button. It can also change speeds by turning a potentiometer.

## Creative Add-on
I added 2 LED arrows which lit up to show which direction the motor was turning.

## Problems
The LED arrows are not very bright because I wired them all to the actual arduino. I tried using the shift register, but wwas having trouble controling which lit up when and also powering them all from the shift register, so I decided to just go with the simpiler method due to time constraints aswell.
