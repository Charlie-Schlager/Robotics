# IR Break Beam Sensors

## Description
I made an IR break beam detection circuit. IF the beam is broken, the serial monitor will print the state of the beam, either broken, or Unbroken. It will also turn off the Arduinos integrated LED depending upon if the beam is broken or not.

## Creative Add-on
I added a piezo speaker and 2 red LED's to simulate an alarm which would be tripped if the IR beam is broken.
